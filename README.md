# mt7915-killer
Unlike generic drivers, **MT7915-Killer** is an ultra-stability, high-performance driver branch for MediaTek MT7915 (Wi-Fi 6) Based on [openwrt/mt76](https://github.com/openwrt/mt76) (Dec 2022) with patches up to March 2026 (excl. WED). This project moves beyond simple patching to implement deep driver-level logic optimization and kernel-level task offloading.

# The Technical Breakthrough
The true bottleneck of leagcy CPU MT7621 under Wi-Fi 6 is not raw data throughput, but Interrupt & Sampling Overhead. High-frequency HRTIMERs and redundant statistics polling lead to physical saturation of CPU3, creating a "performance aging" effect. By thinning these tasks, we achieve industrial-grade stability.

## Key Driver Optimizations (Linux 5.4.268)
  - **Stats_2 Lightweight Sampling**: The most important fix - Drastically reduced Wi-Fi statistics polling frequency, eliminating the "aging" effect where throughput drops after 12+ hours.
  - MSDU density: changed from 4μs to 5us, forcing the hardware to aggregate more packets per interrupt, achieving a 99.92% MSDU aggregation rate.
  - Heartbeat Scaling (HZ=1): Synchronized the driver heartbeat to 1 second, freeing CPU3 from high-frequency timer storms.
  - Memory Optimization: Downgraded DMA allocation to Order-0 (4KB) to prevent latency and allocation failures caused by memory fragmentation on    MIPS architectures.
  - WIFI5 Tuning: Optimized MSDU aggregation (Max 3 packets) for WIFI5 NICs (e.g., Killer-1535).
  - NAPI Throttle (Presudo Hard-IRQ delay): Implemented ```mcu_poll_cnt``` intercept in ```mt7915_poll_tx``` to dealy Hard-IRQ.
  - Real Hard-IRQ delay: DebugFS tweaking supported.
  - Descriptor Slimming: Reduced RX queues (8->5) and downsized/optimized the size of RX/TX_RING, MCU, and WTBL descriptors.
  - Thread Affinity: Hard-coded mt76-tx workqueue to CPU2 to avoid IPI drift.

## Recommended Architecture (CPU Affinity)
  - CPU0/1/3: Bind NAPI POLL workqueues and user-space apps.
  - CPU2: Bind Hard IRQs (mt7915e, mt7915e-hif) and mt76-tx workqueues.
  - CPU3: Also Offload HRTIMER tasks from CPU2 (sharing L1 Cache via VPE).
  - All Ifaces should set rx-0/rps_cpus = 0. (NAPI-POLL mode)

## Stress Test Summary
  - Tested on MT7621 @1000MHz(Overclocking) with Killer-1535 NIC (PC runs on ```iperf3 -R -w 1M -P 1```)
  - Uptime Milestone: Successfully completed a 26.5-hour continuous stress test without a single drop.
  - Throughput Stability: Maintained a consistent 320-340Mbps "straight-line" performance.
  
**Note:**
  During stress testing, all `napi-workq` processes—as well as the core MT7915 driver worker process, `mt76-tx`—operated at the kernel's default priority.
